            My name is Kaappo, I'm 18 years old and I currently I study at Otaniemi Upper Secondary School at their
            mathematics and science program. I have programmed since I was six, and thus programming is very close
            to my heart. Despite my relatively young age, I have a lot of experience developing software, both
            professionally and for fun.

            In addition to programming, my hobbies include photography, all event technology -related matters, and
            playing the guitar.
