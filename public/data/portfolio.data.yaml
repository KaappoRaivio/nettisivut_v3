              It supports diffuse and specular reflections, refraction, fresnel effects, different materials and shapes, as well as reading a mesh from a .obj file.
              It's written in c++ and utilises OpenMP to parallelize the calculations. </p>
              <p>Through various optimizations, mainly the utilization of bounding volume hierarchies, the rendering times are quite competetive for a single-person passion project.
              <p>In addition, I am currently working on a Youtube video on the topic.</p>

              <p>My most desired use case from the very beginning was to use my smartphone as a client.
              Phone screens are quite small, which means that the number one design goal for the project
              is <strong>no wasted screen real estate</strong>.</p>

              <p>Another important factor is that I want a robust solution. This means that <strong>no unnecessary complexity is allowed</strong> which could break something. For example, I decided in the very beginning that  all of the instruments should conform to a grid (although it is possible to sub-divide the grid), and not be resizeable.</p>
              <p>The third objective is to make processing the information easier by <strong>representing it in the best way possible</strong>.</p>
